In the spirit of the original assignment, which was an exercise in building website navigation using ```a``` tags that lead to individual HTML files, I have kept each page as a separate HTML which is accessed by clicking the links in the top nav bar. The code in each HTML page is nearly identical except for differences in content loaded by the JavaScript for that page.

Ideally, I would have built this website as a single-page-application by creating an Angular component and service to fetch and display the content.
